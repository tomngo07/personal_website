                Hello, My name is Tom and I love to do a lot of things during my
                day. These activities branch from working out to gaming and also
                to a lot of other activities. I would love to introduce to you
                some of the daily activities that I love doing the most.

                  Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by a company called
                  Mojang. I love to play their "survival" game mode and let my
                  creativity take me away

                  CounterStrike Global Offensive is also one of my favorite
                  games. It is a first person shooter game where you and your
                  teammates have to eliminate the other team before they
                  eliminate you. You can also win by planting the bomb or saving
                  the hostage, this all varies depending on the map. Ever since
                  CSGO became free, a lot of coders have managed to create
                  cheats for the game, so now most of the community are
                  cheaters, including myself. There are custom games created by
                  players where only cheaters come and play. This is the type of
                  server that I like to play on.

                  FIFA Mobile is the official mobile version of the realistic
                  soccer game where there are a variety of game modes to choose
                  from. The most popular (and only game mode) you can play when
                  on a mobile device is ultimate team. This is where you start
                  from nothing and work your way up by collecting coins and
                  obtaining players. In ultimate team there are multiple ways to
                  collect coins, you can win online matches, do objectives, buy
                  and sell players, etc.
